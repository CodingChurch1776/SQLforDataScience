Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review (User_id) = 9581
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo (Business_id) = 6493
viii. Tip (Business_id) = 3979
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	There is no direct guarentee or causation of more reviews leading to more fans as even someone with 20 reviews was able to generate some fan following versus many reviewers with higher review counts having single digit numbers of fans. Overall though, having a higher review_count does seem to give a reviewer a better chance at generating a larger fanbase
	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: There were more mentions of reviews with love in them than hate. Love appeared 1780 times, while hate only appeared 232 times.

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
 Select
count(text)
From review
WHERE text LIKE '%love%'

Select
count(text)
From review
WHERE text LIKE '%hate%' 
	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT name, fans
FROM user
Order BY fans DESC
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
name      | fans |
+-----------+------+
| Amy       |  503 |
| Mimi      |  497 |
| Harald    |  311 |
| Gerald    |  253 |
| Christine |  173 |
| Lisa      |  159 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours? The restaurants with the higher humber of stars tended to open earlier and close earlier versus the lower rated restaurants opened and closed late. 


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews? The restaurants with the highre number of stars had more reviews.
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
The lower rated restaurant did not even have a location listed where the higher rated restaurants were located in popular areas like Chinatown and Summerlin within Las Vegas.

SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT business.city,
category.category,
business.name,
business.stars,
hours.hours,
review_count
FROM category
JOIN Business on CATEGORY.business_id = Business.id
JOIN hours on business.id = hours.business_id
Where city = 'Las Vegas' and category = 'Restaurants'
Group by name
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: The businesses that are open come away with total of 31198 stars while the businesses that are closed only have 5351 stars between them.
         
         
ii. Difference 2: The businesses that are open come away with total of 269300 reviews while the businesses that are closed only have 35261 reviews between them.
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:


SELECT
SUM(review_count) as numberofreviews
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 1


SELECT
SUM(review_count) as numberofreviews
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 0


SELECT
SUM(stars) as numberofstars
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 1


SELECT
SUM(stars) as numberofstars
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 0
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
I am wanting to find the top ten best and worst businesses in North Carolina so that I can know what to put on my bucket list and what to avoid based off of stars and rating count.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I will need to mainly be working with the business table as that contains the key fields I will need such as business names, city, state, stars and review count. In order to find the top ten best businesses, I will first filter down to only businesses with the state value 'NC'. I will then need to filter out any businesses with less than a 5.0 rating. I will then order the result set by decending number of reviews so that I will have a guaranteed 5 star restaurant with the highest number of reviews. I will then do the exact opposite for the worst businesses, filtering out any businesses higher than a 1.0 rating, but I will still need to order the dataset from a decending direction as I will get a better concensus on if the business is truly bad by having as many reviews weighing in as possible.
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
Top 10 Best Businesses in NC:
